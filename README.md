## How does BAVART work?
After the user signs in, they can scroll through the available art up for auction and bid on the item of their choosing.  When the time runs out on the item whoever the higher bidder is will be the new owner of the art piece.
Users can also add artwork of their own to be placed in the auction page of BAVART
